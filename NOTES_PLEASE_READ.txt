--The anonymization method of the MR sequences was changed to prevent UID data in DICOM images.

--All gallbladder "vena cava inferior" areas were excluded from the liver in ground truth data.
--The shape of the kidneys are determined elliptical as much as possible. Veins, small artifacts are included to the kidney if they are inside of the kidneys elliptical contour.
